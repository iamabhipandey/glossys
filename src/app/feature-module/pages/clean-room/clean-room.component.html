          <strong>Loche Bio</strong> designs and supplies modular cleanroom environments specifically engineered for
          medical device, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical production. Our cleanrooms are built to meet strict regulatory
          expectations — including <strong>ISO 14644</strong> standards and GMP guidelines — while remaining flexible
          enough for rapid deployment.
        </p>

        <p class="muted-small">
          Medical device production requires tight control over airborne particulates, pressure differentials, and
          humidity. Loche Bio’s systems are tested and validated to ensure Class 100 (ISO 5) and other target
          classifications as required by your process.
        </p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Custom modular layouts:</strong> free-standing or wall-integrated solutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Precision environmental control:</strong> pressure, temperature, humidity, and contamination monitoring.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance-ready:</strong> engineered to support ISO 14644 and ISO 13485 requirements.</li>
        </ul>
